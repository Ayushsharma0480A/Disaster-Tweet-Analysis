# Disaster-Tweet-Analysis
Twitter plays a vital role in emergencies, allowing real-time announcements of disasters. However, distinguishing between tweets about actual disasters and figurative language (e.g., "ABLAZE" used metaphorically) is challenging for machines.

We are trying to build a machine learning model to classify tweets as disaster-related or not, using a hand-labeled dataset of 10,000 tweets. Note that the dataset may contain offensive language.
